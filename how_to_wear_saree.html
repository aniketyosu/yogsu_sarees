        <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Draping a Saree:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Choose the Right Saree and Accessories:</strong> Select a
            saree that suits your occasion and pair it with a matching blouse,
            petticoat, and accessories.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Start with the Petticoat:</strong> Wear a well-fitted
            petticoat underneath your saree and tie it securely at your waist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tuck the Saree Into the Petticoat:</strong> Tuck the plain
            end of the saree into the petticoat, starting from your right side
            and wrapping it around the waist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Create Pleats:</strong> Make 5-7 even pleats and tuck them
            securely into the petticoat at the center of your waist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Drape the Pallu Over the Shoulder:</strong> Bring the pallu
            over your left shoulder, letting it fall gracefully.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adjust the Length:</strong> Ensure the length of the saree
            touches the floor but does not drag. Adjust the pallu length
            accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pin the Pallu in Place:</strong> Use safety pins to secure
            the pallu and pleats in place.
          </li>
        </ol>
